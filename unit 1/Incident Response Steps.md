There are 6 steps

<h2>Preparation</h2>

The preparation phase is about ensuring you have the appropriate response plans, policies, and other documents in place and that you have identified the members of your incident response team including external entities.

<h2>Identification</h2>

In this phase, we need to work out whether we are dealing with an event or an incident. We need to look for significant deviations from "Normal" traffic baselines or other methods.

<h2>Containment</h2>

In this stage, we limit and prevent any further damage from occurring. This includes long-term and short-term containment activities.

<h2>Eradication</h2>

During the fourth stage, emphasis is on ensuring you have a clean system ready to restore. This may be a complete reimage of a system or a restore from a known good backup.

<h2>Recovery</h2>

At this point, it's time to determine when to bring the system back into production and how long we monitor the system for any signs of abnormal activity.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

This the most critical phase, we learn from incidents and we incorporate additional activities and knowledge back into the incident response process.
